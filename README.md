# Chatbot-Song-Recommender-System
Music is an integral part of our lives. However, since the social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram have a huge influence on the music charts worldwide, users 
are exposed solely to mainstream music and therefore the recommendations on music streaming platforms are not very personalized. 
A song and emotion-based recommendation system permits the users to listen to music based on their emotions.
Existing systems use audio signals using the DNN approach and collaborative filtering to recommend songs based on the user's history. 
The proposed work develops a personalized system, where the user's current emotion is analysed with the help of the chatbot. 
The chatbot identifies the user's sentiment by asking some general questions. Based on the input provided by the user, current emotion or mood is analysed
by the chatbot and it will generate the playlist. The proposed recommendation system utilizes the APIs for the playlist generation and recommendation. 
In this project, an open-source tool is built to create a Chatbot that recommends songs based on the tone of the conversation between the user and  the chatbot.
This song recommendation feature employs the use of Last.fm API, which is very much similar to the popular Spotify API. 
Also for tone/emotion analysis of the conversation the IBM Watson API is used.
